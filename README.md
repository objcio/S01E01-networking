# Swift Talk
## Networking

This is the code that accompanies Swift Talk Episode 1: [Networking](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E01-networking)

It has been slightly adapted to work with Xcode 9 / Swift 4.

* some syntactical and type changes
* use of new JSONDecoder(), which simplifies code lot - see [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder)
